# Non-Gating Rule Modifiers

The following rule identifiers adjust confidence but do not determine the final judgment:

- `END_OF_MATTER_SUPPORT` – applies a small bonus when the ruler of the 4th house favors the querent or the Moon through aspect or reception.
- `SIGNIFICATOR_ANGULARITY` – modifies confidence based on whether significators occupy angular, succedent, or cadent houses.
